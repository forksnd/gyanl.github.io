Hello, my name is Gyan Lakhwani. I am a designer and a nerd, and this website is a place for me to document my thoughts and try out experiments with code. If you find something broken (which is likely because I keep trying out things), please tweet at me [@gyanl](https://twitter.com/gyanl).

#### Work
I'm currently working on voice experiences at Microsoft. I have also previously worked on digital products with names like Google and Zomato, as well as a number of smaller startups.

#### Education
I have a Master's degree in Interaction Design from IDC School of Design at IIT Bombay and a Bachelor's degree in IT Engineering from IP University, Delhi.

#### Website
This website is a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub Pages. I wrote a custom CSS theme that has dark and light mode support, accent color variables, as well as nice typography. There is some documentation in my [GitHub](https://github.com/gyanl/gyanl.github.io) if you want to try using this theme.

#### Mentors
A list of people I look up to.
- [Achal Varma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achalv/) was a senior at school and the first person I knew with a career in design. He made the little Spotify micro-animation when you tapped the heart button to add a song to your liked songs. He's also the coolest guy I know.
- [Ashish Goel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashpodel/) was my manager during my internship at Zomato. I picked up my love of [sketchnoting](https://gyanl.com/tag/sketchnotes) from him, and he also brought me on board as a freelancer for a number of my early design projects. Read his book [Drawing on Courage](https://www.amazon.in/Drawing-Courage-Stanford-d-school-Library/dp/B09HN52GCJ)!
- [Ravi Sinha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-kumar-sinha/) was my mentor at my first ever internship at Surgge. Ravi read a lot and had a lot of product insights. I learnt a lot about designing for an outcome.
