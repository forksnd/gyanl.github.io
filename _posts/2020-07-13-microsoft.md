I started my first job as a UX Designer at Microsoft soon after finishing my Master's degree in Interaction Design at IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay. I joined the Canvas Voice team in Noida, which worked on experiences like Dictation, Transcription, Read Aloud and Voice Search across Microsoft apps like Word, Outlook and OneNote. I later worked on Microsoft Designer, and then Microsoft Word.

### Rethinking Read Aloud for Word mobile

- Read Aloud is a text to speech feature in Microsoft Word. It was first introduced on Desktop, where it is frequently used to proof-read documents for tone and typos. Word on mobile devices is used more for consuming documents, and our hypothesis was that Read Aloud would be used very differently on mobile. 
- I conducted user studies to find out more about how mobile users consume information with voice, and proposed mobile-specific design improvements for Read Aloud. 

### Presenter Coach for PowerPoint Mobile

- Presenter Coach helps users rehearse their presentations with AI-powered live feedback. Things like using too many filler words, repeating phrases and reading off the slides are immediately flagged, and a detailed report is generated at the end of the session. 
- The smaller size of mobile screens limited what could be shown to users during a rehearsal, and I prototyped a number of possible visual treatments and tested with users to find what they found most helpful. 

### Dictation for OneNote mobile

- OneNote on mobile devices has a sticky notes for quickly capturing information, as well as fully fledged OneNote notebooks. I conducted user studies to find out how people use voice technologies to capture thoughts - from using recorded memos as reminders, to students recording lectures to review later. 
- I worked with the OneNote team to introduce voice as a new input method for both sticky notes and Onenote notebooks.

### Transcription in Microsoft Word

- Transcription on Word Web converts audio recordings into a text transcript, with timestamped sections separated by speaker. Snippets from the transcript can then be used in the Word document. 
- I was responsible for using user feedback to improve support for multiple recordings, adding dark mode support, and extending the feature to Windows.

### Mobile refresh for Word, Excel & PowerPoint

- You can do a lot with the Office suite of apps, and for years the apps have used the *Ribbon menu* on desktop to organise all the commands. When the WXP Apps were first launched on mobile, they borrowed the structure of the Ribbon to maintain familiarity, with adaptations to the still-new paradigms of mobile apps. 
- I was part of a team that rethought the aging mobile interface, and created new unified design patterns for commanding and navigation across Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

### Microsoft Designer mobile app

- Microsoft Designer powers graphic asset creation with the power of AI. 
- I worked on bringing the Designer experience to Android, and created the design library that was used to adapt the desktop experience to mobile, and worked on a new generative AI approach to creating social media posts with natural language descriptions. 

### Microsoft Word for iPad
- I explored AI content creation possibilities for Word - this involved understanding prompts for LLMs, and creating interfaces that nudged users towards better prompts. 
- I work on improving experiences like Tables, Borders, Images to be delightful, platform-native experiences that make sense for touch, keyboard, trackpad, and pencil users on iPads.

### Microsoft Word for Web
- Designing next generation of Office experiences to feel more modern and intuitive.
