I once found myself tasked with adding checklists to Microsoft Word. I initially did not believe that this was too complicated. Checklists are a well understood interface design pattern, and not an area where I felt we needed to reinvent the wheel. You click on a checklist marker, and the item changes to a checked state. Clicking on the marker again switches back to the not-checked state. 

#### Problem Statement

What should the checklists experience for Word be like?

### The challenge

Working on a product thatâ€™s been around for 40 years sometimes throws some really unique challenges at you. After I designed some of these neat little mockups, I found myself in a seemingly impossible situation. The Word Web team was convinced that checklists would be a useful addition to Word. The myriad other platform teams (Windows, Mac, Android, iPad, iOS) were not as convinced, and also had their own priorities and backlogs.

After some discussion, it was agreed that the Web team could try implementing the feature as an experiment, but would not initially get any bandwidth from any of the other platform teams. Target metrics were defined, and if they were met then the other teams would pick up the work later. This seemed fair enough. 

The tricky part was that documents created on Word for Web needed to continue to render correctly on all the other platforms. While Word Web users always see the latest version of the software every time they load a document in their browser, many Desktop users bought versions of Word developed years ago and continue to use them. It was not acceptable to have someone send them a document that had a checklist which they could not view correctly.

#### Revised Problem Statement

How might we implement checklists in Microsoft Word so that they work on every version of Word released in the past few years Web, Windows, Mac, Android & iOS with no code changes on those platforms?
