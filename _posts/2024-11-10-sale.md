# Hello!

Welcome to my garage sale. This is where I put up things that I am no longer using and I feel could be put to better use by someone else. I’ve done this yearly for the past two years, and it’s been great to see unused things find a new home. Feel free to look around—maybe you’ll find something for yourself!

#### Will you deliver the items?

Items can be picked up from my house in Delhi NCR (Vasant Kunj) or I could Dunzo the smaller items. I’d prefer if you can pick the more expensive items up yourself since that gives you a chance to look at the item and make sure the condition is what you expect, and it’s less hassle for me.

#### Will you consider trade offers?

I may be willing to do this. Reach out if you have an offer!

#### I have some things to sell. Can you put them up here?

At that point we’re re-inventing OLX, but if I know you reasonably well let me know and maybe we can figure something out. 

#### I have more questions

Message me on [WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=7982121546&text&type=phone_number) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gyanl) if you have questions or want photos/more details.

# Available Items

#### Edifier R1280DB Bookshelf Speakers

*If you care about audio quality but are on a budget, the Edifier R1280DB speakers show up on a lot of lists for being excellent entry level audiophile gear. These are great sounding speakers with a neutral tuning. I used these along with a turntable as well as my home theatre setup, and they were great for both. Can be used wired or in Bluetooth mode. They come with a removable cover on the front, so you can use them either with the gray fabric finish, or with the more retropunk look without the cover. Comes with original box and cables.*

#### Xbox Series S (White, with 1 Controller)   

_I don't have as much time as I would have liked to play games so I'm letting my Xbox go. It's in great condition and comes with the original box and one controller._

**Amazon:** [Xbox Series S](https://www.amazon.in/Xbox-Series-S/dp/B08J89D6BW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.T0cpfddAxSpQjnQVV_GkJLo6_jI-lxosPv26omc-nRoc7okuL-DllncjMExp7_SjoohszXTMV7QtMSLb8E6mM-IPw9CGXgt57ggBCfnLDCfHMRXvJjwlOaVbnf5FHODblgepoQ93zPFKJt-sWvUwtLZtSiQ4pOME5__6s0tcODajBW-jSgffQ3dnn3x1Gc7X8dDcbwxMJPhD_ICF0XxvBqNndT1zZxMCYbF-fWcf838.YlgVjWK_V0tcSVEm1PA9X0CGDGzWKz-zJbZx015wSOo&dib_tag=se&keywords=xbox%2Bseries%2Bs&qid=1731235086&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) (33,999)

#### Xbox One Controller 

*Mostly the same as Series S controller except no dedicated share button and it uses Micro-USB instead of USB-C. Fully compatible with previous gen Xbox One and current gen Series S and Series X. Also works with Windows and Apple devices for games via Bluetooth or USB. The standard box doesn't have a Micro-USB cable but I bought one so I'll include that.*

#### Wanbo T6 Max 1080p Portable Projector

*A compact 1080p projector for home theatre use that can be used to project on any white wall. Originally bought on Amazon for 29.5k in Oct 2022, selling it cheap for 2 reasons: I tripped over the HDMI cable and yanked it out once so the HDMI port is now a bit loose (still works fine as long as you don't jiggle the cable) and the Android version is a bit old so the built-in Netflix, Prime, etc. apps don't work properly. The projection hardware is still pretty great as long as you are willing to use it with the HDMI-in mode with a laptop, Fire stick, or something else.

- Accepts up to 4k input, 1080p Full HD output

- Built-in speakers, option for 3.5mm Audio out and Bluetooth

- Low latency HDMI mode for Gaming

- Remote control for focus adjustment, volume, etc.

#### Caffé Birraio Decoris Home Espresso Machine (Royal Blue)

*A compact home espresso machine with an automatic and manual mode, steam wand, pressure barometer, timer display and 1.7 liter refillable water tank. If you want to make café style coffee at home, this machine will seriously up your game.*

Note: This machine works best with a grind size that’s closer to commercial espresso, and the Baratza coffee grinder that I am also selling only goes to a home espresso grind size. I have another Caffé Birraio grinder that I will put up for sale later that is ideal for this machine.

#### Canon EOS 1300D DSLR Camera

*Great if you want to get into photography and learn to shoot manual but aren't sure if you want to invest 60-70k into a new mirrorless camera. In outdoor lighting you can get stunning photos that are still way better than any phone camera, but it does struggle a little indoors without flash. Also has a feature to wirelessly transfer photos to phones, so you can totally post to the 'gram on the go.*

#### Office Chair

#### iPad Pro 10.5 inch (Space Gray)

_I bought this 2nd gen iPad Pro during my masters for reading and drawing, but I don’t find myself using it as much anymore. It served me well, and despite being an older iPad it’s still really good at iPad stuff - it can run the current version of iPadOS, and there’s no problem with watching Youtube, light browsing, multitasking and even light gaming. Supports first generation Apple Pencil (not included)._

#### Google Chromecast Audio

![](https://gyanl.com/assets/sale-chromecast-audio.jpg)

*Do you have an old pair of speakers lying around that still sound good, but it's just too much hassle to actually use them anymore? Hook up this Chromecast to it with a 3.5mm audio cable and it can now play music over WiFi. (Also supports digital audio but you'll need to separately buy a Mini Toslink to Toslink cable for that.)*

#### Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation)

*Kindle with a backlit screen. Great for reading on the go, the e-ink screen feels a lot like paper and the battery lasts forever. Newer kindles have smaller bezels and more lighting options but e-ink display technology hasn't changed much, so this is still a great Kindle.*

*High sensitivity gaming mouse that's also great for general use.

#### LG 25 inch Ultrawide monitor (2560x1080)

_LG Monitor with a pixel density of ~110 PPI, which makes it one of the few monitors that can be used perfectly with MacOS at native scaling. Has been my daily driver for about two years, and the colors are good enough to use for design work. Selling it cheap because of some scratches on the screen - not very noticeable unless you're on a plain white screen._
