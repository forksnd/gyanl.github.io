# Hello!

Welcome to my garage sale. This is where I put up things that I am no longer using and I feel could be put to better use by someone else. Iâ€™ve done this yearly for the past two years and [sold](https://gyanl.com/sold) a bunch of unused things and itâ€™s been great to see them find a new home. Feel free to look aroundâ€”maybe youâ€™ll find something for yourself!

#### Will you deliver the items?

Items can be picked up from my house in Delhi NCR (Vasant Kunj) or I could parcel the smaller items. Iâ€™d prefer if you can pick the more expensive items up yourself since that gives you a chance to look at the item and make sure the condition is what you expect, and itâ€™s less hassle for me.

#### I have questions

Message me onÂ [WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=7982121546&text&type=phone_number) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gyanl)Â if you have questions or want photos/more details.

# Available Items

#### Dell 27 Inch 1440p 165Hz Gaming Monitor

_A gaming monitor that I used for gaming as well as design work. The high refresh rate (165 Hz using Displayport cables, 144Hz using HDMI cables) made it a great choice for gaming, and the solid color coverage (98% DCI-P3) meant I was comfortably able to use it for design work in Figma. Iâ€™ll throw in a Displayport to USB-C cable that lets you use this monitor at full resolution and highest possible refresh rate over USB-C._

_Bought on Amazon in August 2022, selling because I donâ€™t play video games anymore._

#### Canon EOS 1300D DSLR Camera

*Great if you want to get into photography and learn to shoot manual but aren't sure if you want to invest 60-70k into a new mirrorless camera. In outdoor lighting you can get stunning photos that are still way better than any phone camera, but it does struggle a little indoors without flash. Also has a feature to wirelessly transfer photos to phones, so you can totally post to the 'gram on the go.*
