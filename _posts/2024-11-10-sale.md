# Hello!

Welcome to my garage sale. This is where I put up things that I am no longer using and I feel could be put to better use by someone else. Iâ€™ve done this [yearly for the past two years](gyanl.com/sold), and itâ€™s been great to see unused things find a new home. Feel free to look aroundâ€”maybe youâ€™ll find something for yourself!

#### Will you deliver the items?

Items can be picked up from my house in Delhi NCR (Vasant Kunj) or I could Dunzo the smaller items. Iâ€™d prefer if you can pick the more expensive items up yourself since that gives you a chance to look at the item and make sure the condition is what you expect, and itâ€™s less hassle for me.

#### Will you consider trade offers?

I may be willing to do this. Reach out if you have an offer!

#### I have some things to sell. Can you put them up here?

At that point weâ€™re re-inventing OLX, but if I know you reasonably well let me know and maybe we can figure something out. 

#### I have more questions

Message me onÂ [WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=7982121546&text&type=phone_number) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gyanl)Â if you have questions or want photos/more details.

#### CaffÃ© Birraio Decoris Home Espresso Machine (Royal Blue)

*A compact home espresso machine with an automatic and manual mode, steam wand, pressure barometer, timer display and 1.7 liter refillable water tank. If you want to make cafÃ© style coffee at home, this machine will seriously up your game.*

Note: This machine works best with a grind size thatâ€™s closer to commercial espresso, and the Baratza coffee grinder that I am also selling only goes to a home espresso grind size. I have another CaffÃ© Birraio grinder that I will put up for sale later that is ideal for this machine.

#### Baratza Encore Coffee Grinder (White)

*An excellent coffee grinder ideal for manual brews. If you make a lot of coffee and want to step up from a hand grinder, this is an excellent device for you. Has 40 levels going from a fine grind for Home Espresso to coarse for French Press.*

#### Windows PC

_Assembled Desktop PC with Windows installed. It can manage some basic gaming because of the inbuilt graphics. Selling it below the cost of parts because I want to clear up space in my room._

#### Canon EOS 1300D DSLR Camera

*Great if you want to get into photography and learn to shoot manual but aren't sure if you want to invest 60-70k into a new mirrorless camera. In outdoor lighting you can get stunning photos that are still way better than any phone camera, but it does struggle a little indoors without flash. Also has a feature to wirelessly transfer photos to phones, so you can totally post to the 'gram on the go.*

#### Office Chair 

_A comfortable office chair with a red cushioned base. Selling cheap because the back support and height adjustment lever has gone bad. It could probably be fixed, but I donâ€™t have a car and canâ€™t carry it to a repair shop so I donâ€™t really know what to do with it._

#### iPad Pro 10.5 inch (Space Gray)

_I bought this 2nd gen iPad Pro during my masters for reading and drawing, but I donâ€™t find myself using it as much anymore. It served me well, and despite being an older iPad itâ€™s still really good at iPad stuff - it can run the current version of iPadOS, and thereâ€™s no problem with watching Youtube, light browsing, multitasking and even light gaming. Supports first generation Apple Pencil (not included)._

#### Google Chromecast Audio

![](https://gyanl.com/assets/sale-chromecast-audio.jpg)

*Do you have an old pair of speakers lying around that still sound good, but it's just too much hassle to actually use them anymore? Hook up this Chromecast to it with a 3.5mm audio cable and it can now play music over WiFi. (Also supports digital audio but you'll need to separately buy a Mini Toslink to Toslink cable for that.)*

**Flipkart:** [Google Chromecast Audio Media Streaming Device](https://www.flipkart.com/google-chromecast-audio-media-streaming-device/p/itmehc8cdsd4bk9q) (3,299)
