> I was part of a panel called “The Ultimate Face-off” organised by ACM SIGCHI Mumbai Chapter and HCI Professionals Association of India (HCIPAI), which pitted designers against developers to address common gripes each side had with the other. This article contains some of the ideas discussed at the panel.


## Allegations on Designers

#### Visually appealing Designs but difficult to implement within the given timeline and technical constraints.

I think there’s two different allegations here. One is that visually appealing designs are difficult to implement.

I don’t think I agree with the first part. The state of design tools is constantly moving towards more and more complexity, and we’re at the point where some design tools have enough detail in their file formats and work similarly enough to frontend code that they are able to spit out working, responsive code. Figma has plugins that can do this, and Webflow or Framer can do this natively. Complex animations can be handed off as a Lottie json and played back on any platform. If it can be designed, it can be implemented. If the designer you are working with is giving you things that are consistent with your design system, you shouldn’t find yourself in a position where correct sizing, padding, colors or motion are harder to do than incorrect values.

The second part is that designers don’t understand technical complexities and will come up with ideas that aren’t feasible in the available time. This one I actually do agree with, but I would argue that this is how it should be.

Making products requires making tough decisions. There’s always a backlog of a hundred different things that the team could work on, and you always have finite resources, so prioritising items and timeboxing the amount of time spent on some tasks is necessary. 

Every task has an effort to impact ratio - how much of the team’s effort will be required, and how much will it impact the product experience? This makes a lot of sense as a product maker, and I think any product manager will try and optimise for the team’s impact. It’s tempting to ignore the low impact issues altogether, address the low effort high impact things first, and put away the high effort high impact things for later. 

Users don’t know or care about your effort estimations. If you put yourself in the shoes of the user, a minor, regular annoyance that is caused by a shortcut that the product team took to save a week of dev time is still a regular annoyance. As a designer, my job is to advocate for the user. Sometimes we’ll discuss designs and as a product team we’ll decide that it’s not feasible to provide all functionality in the first version and we collectively decide what makes the cut and what doesn’t. To start with a cut down version of the designs because I assume some things can’t be done are actually counter-productive, and makes me take decisions that I might not actually be qualified to make. As a designer I invite healthy conversations and there’s very rarely a directive from design to engineering to do something, and arguably that conversation with diverse viewpoints is crucial to have.

#### Disregard responsive design principles, leading to inconsistent user experiences across different devices and screen sizes.

Different devices have different affordances, and the word consistency gets thrown around a lot. I don’t feel that consistency means that the experience needs to be identical for different devices, there are earned differences based on the device - screen size, touch vs keyboard/mouse input, availability of cameras, microphones, speakers, gyroscopes, etc. 

A website needs to work across a variety of devices, and there’s different design patterns for mobile devices and laptops/desktops, and tablets like iPads are kind of their own thing instead of just being a midpoint. There’s also voice interfaces, chat interfaces, 10 foot interfaces for TVs, and the experience for each point 

It’s been standard practice to make desktop and mobile versions of web designs, and responsive design patterns are quite well established at this point. In my experience there has rarely been a moment where a developer and I disagreed on how to handle responsive designs. It’s possible that a case gets 

#### less prioritise the technical feasibility of your design choices.
#### adequately communicate the rationale behind your design decisions, making it challenging for developers to grasp the underlying user experience goals

I usually invite developers to join in for user research sessions, both for open ended directional research and for user testing for specific flows. Developers very rarely attend these interviews, and while I think that a product maker should know and understand what the customer 

## Allegations on Developers
#### Not fully prioritize scalability in design, which makes accommodating future changes challenging.
#### Occasionally, you prioritize speed over quality, leading to rushed solutions.
#### You occasionally resist design feedback, hindering collaboration and preventing design improvements.

I think accepting feedback in general is a difficult activity, and one of the things junior designers tend to struggle with as well. The tendency to start defending yourself when someone is offering feedback is one of the things design school knocked out of me, and something I’m glad for. Well meaning feedback from another person is a gift and an opportunity to improve your craft. Seeing it as hostility towards your work is setting yourself up for failure.

#### You don't follow pixel perfect design specifications and guidelines.

This remains a workflow challenge that hasn’t been solved too well by anyone. 

Figma has done some work on making the design process more like code with concepts like reusable components and variables and states, and “dev mode” that does some nifty things like show designs inside of the vs code code editor and have a different interface from the design interface. 

Either developers need to get a sense for design and how design softwares are organised, or the designer needs to make an effort to learn what implementation details are crucial to write down and express.
