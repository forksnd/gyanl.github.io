# Hello!

This page serves as an archive for things that I have previously sold through my [Garage Sale](gyanl.com/sale) page. 

<br>
#### Wood desk  

_A large desk that I got custom made because I couldn't find something big enough for my liking. The left front leg has a slight construction issue, but if you can’t tell in this photo you probably won’t notice when using it._

#### Edifier R1280DB Bookshelf Speakers

*If you care about audio quality but are on a budget, the Edifier R1280DB speakers show up on a lot of lists for being excellent entry level audiophile gear. These are great sounding speakers with a neutral tuning. I used these along with a turntable as well as my home theatre setup, and they were great for both. Can be used wired or in Bluetooth mode. They come with a removable cover on the front, so you can use them either with the gray fabric finish, or with the more retropunk look without the cover. Comes with original box and cables.*

#### Wanbo T6 Max 1080p Portable Projector

*A compact 1080p projector for home theatre use that can be used to project on any white wall. Originally bought on Amazon for 29.5k in Oct 2022, selling it cheap for 2 reasons: I tripped over the HDMI cable and yanked it out once so the HDMI port is now a bit loose (still works fine as long as you don't jiggle the cable) and the Android version is a bit old so the built-in Netflix, Prime, etc. apps don't work properly. The projection hardware is still pretty great as long as you are willing to use it with the HDMI-in mode with a laptop, Fire stick, or something else.*

- Accepts up to 4k input, 1080p Full HD output

- Built-in speakers, option for 3.5mm Audio out and Bluetooth

- Low latency HDMI mode for Gaming

- Remote control for focus adjustment, volume, etc.

#### Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation)

*Kindle with a backlit screen. Great for reading on the go, the e-ink screen feels a lot like paper and the battery lasts forever. Newer kindles have smaller bezels and more lighting options but e-ink display technology hasn't changed much, so this is still a great Kindle.*

#### Asus ROG Gaming PC

_Gaming PC that can play most games at good framerates at 1080p. RGB lights for extra gamer power. Power button is a bit loose and needs to be jiggled a little for initial boot but otherwise in good condition._

#### Wacom Pen & Touch drawing tablet with stylus

*A great entry-level drawing tablet. Can switch between pen mode and a touch mode using a switch on the device - touch mode essentially converts the surface into a giant trackpad with multi-touch gestures like pinch to zoom and swipe.*

#### Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro (Android Phone)

#### LG 25 inch Ultrawide monitor (2560x1080)

_LG Monitor with a pixel density of ~110 PPI, which makes it one of the few monitors that can be used perfectly with MacOS at native scaling. Has been my daily driver for about two years, and the colors are good enough to use for design work. Selling it cheap because of some scratches on the screen - not very noticeable unless you're on a plain white screen._

#### HP Envy 14 inch laptop (1080p)

_Old laptop, not in great condition. Has three dead pixel bands on the screen. It does have a generous amount of RAM and a graphics card so it’s not a terrible machine if you’re willing to tinker with it._
