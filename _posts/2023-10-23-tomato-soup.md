### Ingredients:

- 6 large tomatoes
- 1 head of garlic
- Olive oil
- Salt & pepper
- A few fresh basil leaves
- Brown sugar, to taste
- Soy sauce, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Preparation:**
    - Preheat your oven to a range of 160-180°C.
    - Quarter the tomatoes and place them on a baking tray.
    - Place a whole head of garlic on the tray.
    - Drizzle olive oil over the tomatoes and garlic, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.
2. **Roasting:**
    - Place the tray in the oven and roast for about 40 minutes. For a deeper flavor, you can extend the roasting time slightly, but be sure to check every few minutes to prevent burning.
3. **Blending:**
    - Once roasted, remove the tray from the oven and allow to cool.
    - After cooling, peel the garlic and place it in a blender along with the roasted tomatoes (and basil leaves if available).
    - Blend until smooth.
4. **Cooking:**
    - Pour the blended mixture into a saucepan and place on medium heat.
    - Season with salt, pepper, brown sugar, and soy sauce to taste.
    - Stir well and let it simmer for a few minutes until it reaches your desired consistency.
5. **Serving:**
    - Serve hot, garnished with a fresh basil leaf if desired, and accompanied by a grilled cheese sandwich.
