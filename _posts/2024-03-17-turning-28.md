What would I like turning 28 to feel like? What would future Gyan be proud of to have had accomplished?

Gratitude for what I have

Moments of clarity/rest/peace/connection

with myself, other people, activities

The significance of buying a sofa. “This is my place!” you announce to the world!

What do I want my relationship with Neel to feel like?

### Settling into word

Manali

Moving out of supernova

### Summer sublet

Nisarg and hauz khas market 

### New house

Moving in with Charu

Record player

Bed that I fit on

View of the trees

### Trip to Deoli khan

nanu’s ashes
