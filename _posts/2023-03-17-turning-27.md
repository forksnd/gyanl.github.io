2022-23 was the year I felt my life started feeling normal after the pandemic. I finally got COVID, and it thankfully wasn’t too bad. I went to the office a lot more, met a lot of my colleagues and made friends at work, travelled a bunch, and eventually stopped feeling paranoid about crowds and stopped wearing a mask.

#### Mussoorie and getting COVID (May 2022)

The Designer team had an offsite in Mussoorie, and I met a lot of my colleagues for the first time. It was a fun trip, and I also crashed my old team’s offsite in Dehradun on my way back.

After holding out for over two years, I finally got caught the big C. I was pretty horrible for about two days, and the brain fog I briefly experienced really freaked me out - but I think I escaped relatively unscathed from the experience. 

#### IDC Reunion (June 2022)

I went to Pune to see Niharika and Nishita, and then Bombay to meet my college friends, many of whom I had not met since college abruptly sent us back home in March 2020. The event on campus was formally cancelled since they had a wave of COVID cases, but most people had already booked tickets so we booked a huge Airbnb for a day. The Airbnb was booked for a film shoot the next day, and the film crew had already started setting up their gear while hungover people were struggling to wake up.

#### Bought a ceramic cup (August 2022)

I went for a cup exhibition at Max Mueller Bhawan, and saw a tiny cup I really liked. I didn’t know what I would do with it, but I bought it on a whim. This did not seem very important at the time, but eventually came to feel like an important moment.

#### Moved out again (August 2022)

I moved to Noida again, this time with flatmates.

###### I wanted a large workdesk, and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what size of bed and table would fit best in my room.

###### Our door was missing a number plate, so I cut out some numbers and taped them to the door.

###### What sold me on the (slightly small) room was the glass sliding door to the balcony that brought in so much natural light. On clear days I had a beautiful view of the Noida skyline with the Yamuna below. It reminded me of Bombay.

#### Shimla trip (September 2022)

I travelled to Shimla with my cousin Rabail and friends. I was able to spend some time with my grandparents at their house in Shimla.

###### I was slightly obsessed with this photo of Paarth and Ishita that felt like it could be an album cover

#### Diwali at Supernova (October 2022)

I hosted a Diwali party at my house. It was the first large party I’ve thrown entirely by myself (although Neel came over to help) and I felt glad to have a place of my own to call friends to.

#### Goa (December 2022)

I wanted to see if I could live the digital nomad life for a while and moved to Goa with Mitul and Simran. My takeaway was that I unfortunately like order and predictability in my workday, and finding a new cafe to work out of every day and being on the move constantly felt exhausting. I missed working at a desk with a monitor and an ergonomic chair.

#### Got promoted and changed teams

After a year of working on Microsoft Designer, I was tired of the constant change of directions and long hours that a pre-release new app brought, and I decided to switch teams internally to Microsoft Word. It’s kind of wild that I started my interest in computers with NIIT classes that taught me Word and PowerPoint and I now work on Word.

### Things I want to do at 27
- Feel comfortable with my plan for the next year or two. If I’m in Delhi and working at Microsoft, I should feel okay about that instead of feeling that I’m putting off making a change.
