2022-23 was the year I felt my life started feeling normal after the pandemic. I finally got COVID, and it thankfully wasn’t too bad. I went to the office a lot more, met a lot of my colleagues and made friends at work, travelled a bunch, and eventually stopped feeling paranoid about crowds and stopped wearing a mask.

#### Mussoorie and getting COVID (May 2022)

The Designer team had an offsite in Mussoorie, and I met a lot of my colleagues for the first time. It was a fun trip, and I also crashed my old team’s offsite in Dehradun on my way back.

After holding out for over two years, I finally got caught the big C when I got back from this trip. I was pretty horrible for about two days, and the brain fog I briefly experienced really freaked me out - but I think I escaped relatively unscathed from the experience. 

#### Pune and Bombay IDC Reunion (June 2022)

I went to Pune to see Niharika and Nishita, and then Bombay to meet my college friends, many of whom I had not met since college abruptly sent us back home in March 2020.

###### Driving around Pune with Nishita and Devina

The event on campus was formally cancelled since they had a wave of COVID cases, but most people had already booked tickets so we booked a huge Airbnb for a day. The Airbnb was booked for a film shoot the next day, and the film crew had already started setting up their gear while hungover people were struggling to wake up.

#### Bought a ceramic cup (August 2022)

I went for a cup exhibition at Max Mueller Bhawan, and saw a tiny cup I really liked. I didn’t know what I would do with it, but I bought it on a whim. This did not seem very important at the time, but eventually came to feel like an important moment.

#### Moved out again (August 2022)

I moved to Noida again, this time with flatmates. I found Raunak’s tweet about looking for a 2 BHK in Noida, and based on last years wild goose chase for 1/2 BHKs I pitched moving in together in a 3 BHK. We found a place soon enough that was close to our offices, and started living at Supernova Residency.

###### I wanted a large workdesk, and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what size of bed and table would fit best in my room.

###### Our door was missing a number plate when we moved in. I cut out some numbers and taped them to the door.

###### What sold me on my slightly small room was the glass sliding door to the balcony that brought in so much natural light. On clear days I had a beautiful view of the Noida skyline with the Yamuna below. It reminded me of Bombay. I had to eventually get thicker (less dreamy) curtains because I was getting woken up too early.

#### Shimla trip (September 2022)

I travelled to Shimla with my cousin Rabail and friends. I was able to spend some time with my grandparents at their house in Shimla.

###### I love this photo of Paarth and Ishita that felt like it could be an album cover

#### Diwali at Supernova (October 2022)

I hosted a Diwali party at my house. It was the first large party I’ve thrown entirely by myself (although Neel came over to help) and I felt glad to have a place of my own to call friends to.

#### Saw a solar eclipse

###### On 25 Oct 2022 I saw the first solar eclipse I remember witnessing. It was pretty cool. 

#### Dehradun and Mussoorie again (November 2022)

My friends Raymond, Amya, Laad and I went to Mussoorie and Dehradun. Raymond had a chance to drive his new car, and we stopped at his alma mater UPES.

#### Goa (December 2022)

I hate winters in Delhi. This made it easy to say yes when Mitul asked if I wanted to go to Goa for a month with her and Simran. This was an odd trip, and much of the dysfunction I was experiencing seemed to be waved away by the people there. I went with the flow of things. Perhaps a bit too much.

> “It’s Goa.” - man with car parked in the middle of the road, having a leisurely chat with someone in a house nearby, completely ignoring the honking of cars piling up behind him.

My takeaway was that I unfortunately like order and predictability in my life, and finding a new cafe to work out of every day and being on the move constantly felt exhausting. I missed working at a desk with a monitor and an nice chair.

###### Pranav was in Goa for a work offsite and was unfortunately subjected to my terrible driving (I missed 3 turns in a row and we drove all around Panjim for no reason while listening to Gaddi Red Challenger)

### Teaching (September 2022)

I was invited by the InfoEdge Centre for Entrepreneurship at Ashoka University to conduct a workshop on [Rapid Prototyping in Figma](/figma) as part of their Startup Ashoka program.

I also gave an online talk on [Getting Started with a Career in Design](/design-career) by Metvy Learn.

#### Got promoted and changed teams (Jan 2023)

###### “Are you convinced, Gyan? You don’t look convinced.” Photo with Amitabh and Neha during one of our many discussions. Reader, I was not convinced.

After a year of working on Microsoft Designer, I was tired of the constant change of directions and long hours that a new pre-release app brought, and I decided to switch teams internally to Microsoft Word. I figured an more established product would bring a more stable work life. It’s kind of wild that I started my interest in computers with NIIT classes that taught me Word and PowerPoint and I now work on Word. I made it, mom!

#### Birthday (March 2023)

### Things I want to do at 27
- Feel comfortable with where I am right now. I’ve felt for the past year or two that I’m not trying hard enough to achieve more, and all it’s done is made me anxious and tired. This year I will rest.
- I’ve had enough of living in Noida, and I want to move to Delhi (#SunsetOverTheYamuna)
