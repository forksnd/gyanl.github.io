#### Moved out (again)

I moved to Noida again, this time with flatmates.

###### With Sheetal and Kritika in Mussoorie

The Designer team had an offsite in Mussoorie, and I met a lot of my colleagues for the first time.

#### Got Covid

After holding out for over two years, I finally got caught the big C. I was pretty horrible for about two days, and the brain fog I briefly experienced really freaked me out - but I think I escaped relatively unscathed from the experience. 

#### IDC Reunion

I went to Pune and then Bombay to meet my college friends, many of whom I had not met since college abruptly sent us back home in March 2020.

#### Dehradun and Mussoorie with work 

Short trip with work friends

#### Goa for a month

I wanted to see if I could live the digital nomad life for a while and moved to Goa with Mitul and Simran. My takeaway was that I unfortunately like order and predictability in my work life, and I enjoy working at a desk with a monitor and an ergonomic chair - at least while I have a corporate job. Finding a new cafe to work out of every day and being on the move constantly felt exhausting.

#### Changed teams

After a year of working on Microsoft Designer, I was tired of the constant change of directions and long hours that a pre-release new app brought, and I decided to switch teams internally to Microsoft Word. It’s kind of wild that I started my interest in computers with NIIT classes that taught me Word and PowerPoint and I now work on Word.
