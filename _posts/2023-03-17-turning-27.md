### Turning 27 (2023)

2022-23 was the year I felt my life started feeling normal after the pandemic. I finally got COVID, and it wasn’t too bad. I met a lot of my colleagues, made friends at work, travelled a bunch, and eventually stopped wearing a mask.

#### Moved out (again)

I moved to Noida again, this time with flatmates.

###### Our door was missing a number plate, so I cut out some numbers and taped them to the door.

###### What sold me on the (slightly small) room was the glass sliding door to the balcony that brought in so much natural light. On clear days I had a beautiful view of the Noida skyline with the Yamuna below. It reminded me of Bombay.

#### Mussoorie (May 2022)

The Designer team had an offsite in Mussoorie, and I met a lot of my colleagues for the first time.

#### Got Covid

After holding out for over two years, I finally got caught the big C. I was pretty horrible for about two days, and the brain fog I briefly experienced really freaked me out - but I think I escaped relatively unscathed from the experience. 

#### IDC Reunion

I went to Pune and then Bombay to meet my college friends, many of whom I had not met since college abruptly sent us back home in March 2020. 

#### Shimla trip

Rabail and friends

Spent some time with my grandparents

#### Diwali at Supernova (October 2022)

#### Dehradun and Mussoorie with work 

Short trip with work friends

#### Goa for a month

I wanted to see if I could live the digital nomad life for a while and moved to Goa with Mitul and Simran. My takeaway was that I unfortunately like order and predictability in my work life, and I enjoy working at a desk with a monitor and an ergonomic chair - at least while I have a corporate job. Finding a new cafe to work out of every day and being on the move constantly felt exhausting.

#### Changed teams

After a year of working on Microsoft Designer, I was tired of the constant change of directions and long hours that a pre-release new app brought, and I decided to switch teams internally to Microsoft Word. It’s kind of wild that I started my interest in computers with NIIT classes that taught me Word and PowerPoint and I now work on Word.
