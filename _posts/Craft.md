The Office web apps had accumulated decades of legacy experiences, resulting in outdated and less competitive user experiences. This led many users to prefer competitor offerings over the Microsoft suite. In our push to rapidly ship features, we inadvertently prioritized quantity over quality, further adding to our experience debt. On the Office product teams, we set out to make our web apps flagship products. Our approach was twofold: addressing legacy craft issues and ensuring that new features were shipped with exceptional quality, adding no further experience debt.

Achieving this required a cultural shift across teams, with a focus on craftsmanship at every stage of development. Through a dedicated, systematic approach, we identified and fixed over 500 critical craft issues in FY24. Org-wide craft bug bashes, rigorous craft reviews, and mandatory sign-offs became integral checkpoints in our development process. This initiative not only drastically improved the usability of our web apps but also embedded craftsmanship into our product development culture. 

These efforts have significantly contributed to both product and business success. This was quite evident in our latest benchmarking scores improving from 55% to 79%. WXP Web MAU grew by 11%, with a notable 41% increase in the number of sessions in FY24, compared to 26% in FY23. Engagement among commercial users increased by 2pts, adding 5 Mn new users adopting the web apps. We anticipate further positive impact on NPS and SUS usability scores—Excel’s SUS score alone increased by 7 points for commercial.

These results have been transformative, setting a new standard of excellence—our products are now not only functional but also well-crafted and delightful to use. Here are the key learnings from our journey in establishing a **Culture of Craft** within OPG IDC:  

1. **Craft is Fundamental**: As crucial as performance and reliability, Craft transforms user trust into product love.
2. **Craft as an OKR**: Craft should be an OKR, ensuring it is prioritized alongside other product metrics in planning and development.
3. **Craft must be Measurable**: Tracking Craft through metrics and dashboards ensures transparency, accountability, and progress.
4. **Craft should be Celebrated**: Recognizing and celebrating craftsmanship fosters pride in quality and empowers teams to drive higher standards across product development.
