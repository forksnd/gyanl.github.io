## About Unequal

Unequal is a streetwear brand crafted under a singular, powerful conviction - no two individuals can ever truly be the same. Their ethos celebrates the art of individuality, advocating for a world where every person relishes their unique essence rather than succumbing to the societal pressures of comparison. Unequal inspires authenticity, and fashion is the language through which they speak it.
