### Problem Statement

- Find and Replace on Microsoft Word looks visually outdated
- The dropdown inside the Find bar is confusing
![[Nav Pane - Search Bar Dropdown.png]]

### Hypotheses

- Aligning the visual design for Find & Replace to Fluent v9 will help make Word Web feel more modern. 
- Clear search as an option can be eliminated as it is duplicated functionality.
- Match case, Find whole words should have a tick indicator next to them when enabled.
