#### Apple Homepod (1st Gen)  

_You can throw a party with just one of these, it sounds really good and gets super loud. It's a solid smart speaker if you're mostly in the Apple ecosystem, and especially if you use Apple music._

#### iPad Pro 10.5 inch (Space Gray)

_I bought this 2nd gen iPad Pro during my masters for reading and drawing, but I donâ€™t find myself using it as much anymore. It served me well, and despite being an older iPad itâ€™s still really good at iPad stuff - it can run the current version of iPadOS, and thereâ€™s no problem with watching Youtube, light browsing, multitasking and even light gaming. Supports first generation Apple Pencil (not included)._

#### Google Chromecast Audio

*Do you have an old pair of speakers lying around that still sound good, but it's just too much hassle to actually use them anymore? Hook up this Chromecast to it with a 3.5mm audio cable and it can now play music over WiFi. (Also supports digital audio but you'll need to separately buy a Mini Toslink to Toslink cable for that.)*

**Flipkart:** [Google Chromecast Audio Media Streaming Device](https://www.flipkart.com/google-chromecast-audio-media-streaming-device/p/itmehc8cdsd4bk9q) (3,299)

#### CaffÃ© Birraio Decoris Home Espresso Machine (Royal Blue)

*A compact home espresso machine with an automatic and manual mode, steam wand, pressure barometer, timer display and 1.7 liter refillable water tank. If you want to make cafÃ© style coffee at home, this machine will seriously up your game.*

Note: This machine works best with a grind size thatâ€™s closer to commercial espresso, and the Baratza coffee grinder that I am also selling only goes to a home espresso grind size. I have another CaffÃ© Birraio grinder that I will put up for sale later that is ideal for this machine.

#### Office Chair 

_A comfortable office chair with a red cushioned base. Selling cheap because the back support and height adjustment lever has gone bad. It could probably be fixed, but I donâ€™t have a car and canâ€™t carry it to a repair shop so I donâ€™t really know what to do with it._
