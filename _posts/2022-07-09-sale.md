#### Canon EOS 1300D DSLR Camera
*Older DSLR Camera with an 18-55mm Zoom lens, 16 GB memory card, charger and carrying case. Great if you want to get into photography and learn to shoot manual but aren't sure if you want to invest 30-40k into a new DSLR. In outdoor lighting you can get stunning photos that are still way better than any phone camera. Also has a feature to wirelessly transfer photos to phones, so you can totally post to the 'gram on the go.*

#### Dell Wired USB mouse

**Status:** 🟢 Available

<br>

#### Logitech G102 Gaming Mouse

*High sensitivity gaming mouse that's also great for general use. Has customisable RGB lights, and I keep it on my desk just for how cool the lights look. Selling cheap because the scroll wheel is a bit glitchy - so this is great buy if you play a game that doesn't use the scroll wheel much. It has two programmable side buttons you can map to any action.*

#### Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation)

#### LG 25 inch Ultrawide monitor (2560x1080)

_LG Monitor with a pixel density of ~110 PPI, which makes it one of the few monitors that can be used perfectly with MacOS at native scaling.
