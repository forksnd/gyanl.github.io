# Hello!

Welcome to my garage sale. Feel free to look around. All items are in Delhi. [Message me on WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=7982121546&text&type=phone_number) if you have questions or want photos/more details. Also willing to consider trade offers.

<br>

#### Apple Homepod (The big one, not Homepod mini)  

_You can throw a party with just one of these, it sounds really good and gets super loud. It's a solid smart speaker if you're mostly in the Apple ecosystem, and especially if you use Apple music._

**Flipkart:** [HomePod](https://www.flipkart.com/apple-homepod-siri-assistant-smart-speaker/p/itmd613189c4a516) (19,900)  

**My price:** 14k

**Status:** 🟢 Available

<br>

#### Google Chromecast Audio

*Do you have an old pair of speakers lying around that still sound good, but it's just too much hassle to actually use them anymore? Hook up this Chromecast to it with a 3.5mm audio cable and it can now play music over WiFi. (Also supports digital audio but you'll need to separately buy a Mini Toslink to Toslink cable for that.)*

**Flipkart:** [Google Chromecast Audio Media Streaming Device](https://www.flipkart.com/google-chromecast-audio-media-streaming-device/p/itmehc8cdsd4bk9q) (3,299)

**My Price:** 500

#### 13 inch Macbook Pro (2017)

_Older base model Macbook Pro that got my brother through design school. Still plenty good enough for basic to intermediate tasks._

Intel i5 2.3 GHz + Integrated graphics

8GB RAM

128 GB SSD

**Apple Site:** [MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP754?locale=en_IN)

<br>

#### Dell Wired USB mouse

*A basic computer mouse. Right and left click work, but scroll wheel doesn't work. Seriously, what does it take to make a reliable scroll wheel?*

**My price:** 150

**Status:** 🟢 Available

<br>

#### Logitech G102 Gaming Mouse

*High sensitivity gaming mouse that's also great for general use. Has customisable RGB lights and two programmable side buttons you can map to any action either globally or per app using the Logitech software. I got a similiar wireless model soon after so it's in great condition—comes with original box and wasn't used much.*

#### Xiaomi Router 4c

*A compact Wi-Fi router with 4 antennae, great signal for the size. Had my name written on it on paper tape, can be cleaned off. Or don't, and it's a signed collector's item!*

#### Logitech C310 clip-on 720p Webcam

*Photo clarity is about as good as your average laptop webcam. Connects over USB and clips on to the top of a monitor—see the monitor listing towards the end of this page to see how it looks mounted on the monitor. Also has a built in mic, but it intermittently sounds high pitched so I wouldn't rely on it for audio.*

_Gaming PC that can play most games at good framerates at 1080p. RGB lights for extra gamer power. Power button is a bit loose and needs to be jiggled a little for initial boot but otherwise in good condition._

![](https://gyanl.com/assets/sale-pc.jpg)

Intel Core i5-9400F

16GB DDR4 RAM

512GB SSD (M.2 PCIE) + 1TB HDD

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 6GB

Windows 11 Pro (I'll throw in an Office 365 license key if you want one)

**Amazon:** [ASUS Core i5 (9400F)](https://www.amazon.in/ASUS-GeForce-Graphics-Capacity-GL10CS-IN085T/dp/B083DPG31G/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B5GQ7O7Y2XSX&keywords=asus+rog+pc+i5-9400f&qid=1657347827&sprefix=asus+rog+pc+i5-9400%2Caps%2C179&sr=8-1) - this is a lower model with a GTX 1650 4 GB and 256GB SSD, but looks similar

**My price:** 45k

**Status:** ❌ Sold

<br>

#### Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation)

*Kindle with a backlit screen. Great for reading on the go, the e-ink screen feels a lot like paper and the battery lasts forever. Newer kindles have smaller bezels and more lighting options but e-ink display technology hasn't changed much, so this is still a great Kindle.*

![](https://gyanl.com/assets/sale-kindle.jpg)

**Amazon:** [Kindle Paperwhite (7th gen)](https://www.amazon.in/Kindle-Paperwhite-Resolution-Display-Built/dp/B00QJDOEAO)

#### Tenda AC1200 Gigabit WiFi Router

Amazon: [Tenda AC10 AC1200 Wireless Smart Dual-Band Gigabit WiFi Router](https://www.amazon.in/Tenda-AC10-1200Mbps-Wireless-Router/dp/B07DGPYKLP) (2498) 

**My price:** 1000

**Status:** ❌ Sold

<br>

#### Wacom Pen & Touch drawing tablet with stylus

*A great entry-level drawing tablet. Can switch between pen mode and a touch mode using a switch on the device - touch mode essentially converts the surface into a giant trackpad with multi-touch gestures like pinch to zoom and swipe.*

![](https://gyanl.com/assets/sale-wacom.jpg)

#### Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro (Android Phone)

_Used to be my daily driver till I switched to a new phone. In decent condition because I always used it with a case and screen guard. The screen guard is chipped but the screen is completely intact._

![](https://gyanl.com/assets/sale-android.jpg)

128 GB Storage, 6 GB RAM 

**Xiaomi website:** [Redmi Note 7 Pro Online - Mi India](https://www.mi.com/in/buy/product/redmi-note-7-pro)

#### LG 25 inch Ultrawide monitor (2560x1080)

_LG Monitor with a pixel density of ~110 PPI, which makes it one of the few monitors that can be used perfectly with MacOS at native scaling. Has been my daily driver for about two years, and the colors are good enough to use for design work. Selling it cheap because of some scratches on the screen - not very noticeable unless you're on a plain white screen._

IPS Panel, SRGB >99%, AMD Freesync, 60Hz, 5ms response, 2x HDMI, audio out

#### Miniso Compact mint green wireless keyboard

<br>

#### Canon EOS 1300D DSLR Camera

*Great if you want to get into photography and learn to shoot manual but aren't sure if you want to invest 30-40k into a new DSLR. In outdoor lighting you can get stunning photos that are still way better than any phone camera. Also has a feature to wirelessly transfer photos to phones, so you can totally post to the 'gram on the go.*

#### HP Envy 14 inch laptop (1080p)

_Old laptop, not in great condition. Has three dead pixel bands on the screen. It does have a generous amount of RAM and a graphics card so it’s not a terrible machine if you’re willing to tinker with it._
