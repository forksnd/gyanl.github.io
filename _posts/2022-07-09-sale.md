**Amazon:** [Xbox Series S](https://www.amazon.in/Xbox-Series-S/dp/B08J89D6BW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YOU2FSSIS5XV&keywords=xbox&qid=1657347496&sprefix=xbo%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1) (30,899 + 499/month for Gamepass)

#### Apple Homepod (The big one, not Homepod mini)  

_You can throw a party with just one of these, it sounds really good and gets super loud. It's a solid smart speaker if you're mostly in the Apple ecosystem, and especially if you use Apple music._

#### Logitech G102 Gaming Mouse

Gaming mouse with RGB colors. Scroll wheel doesn't work properly so I'm selling it cheap - great if you play a game that doesn't use the scroll wheel much or you're okay remapping the scroll action to one of the two programmable side buttons.

#### Dell Wired USB mouse

#### LG 25 inch Ultrawide monitor (2560x1080)

_LG Monitor with a pixel density of ~110 PPI, which makes it one of the few monitors that work well with MacOS at native scaling. Has been my daily driver for about two years, and the colors are good enough to use for design work. Selling it cheap because of some scratches on the screen - not very noticeable unless you're on a plain white screen._
