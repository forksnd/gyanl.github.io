##### Kinnari (Moderator)

We're very happy to see so many young professionals joining us today. Without further ado, let's begin with the most awaited event of the evening.

On Team Designers, we have Gyan. Gyan is a Product Designer at Microsoft and also an IDC alumnus. Gyan is particularly happy to be here because he feels we don't invite him to IDC enough. You're always welcome here, Gyan. At Microsoft, he's working on Microsoft Word. In his free time, he's a recreational coder, a typography enthusiast, and enjoys reading science fiction.

Next in the panel, we have Divya, who is also an alumnus of our department. She is currently an Associate Senior Designer at Atlassian. Divya works on the growth team for Jira Service Management. Previously, she has worked with the AI Ops Team, specializing in using AI for incident management. She has a background in fashion and interaction design. She's passionate about women in STEM, mental health awareness, and exploring the world through books and literature.

We also have Nachiket, an alumnus of NID. Nachiket is currently working as a User Experience Designer at IBM. Previously, he has worked as a Front-End Developer at Tech Mahindra. In his free time, he's a creative nomad who loves to wander through art, books, and nature.

Next in Team Developers, we have Ayush, an illustrious alumnus of IIT Bombay from the Computer Science Department. Ayush is an Applied Data Scientist at Microsoft, working with the Bing shopping team in India. He specializes in product ranking and relevance and has also worked at Samsung R&D, focusing on AI-driven phone heating reduction.

We also have Nikhil on Team Developers. Nikhil is currently associated with TurtleMint and has previously worked with TCS. He has a background in instrumentation engineering and a knack for programming. In his free time, he likes to travel and write poems.

Another developer on our panel is Nagaraj, who is joining online. Nagaraj is an alumnus of VIT and is currently working with HP Inc. as a Framework Technical Lead for UI. Prior to HP, he worked as a Senior Technical Manager in Samsung mobiles and printers, developing various in-house platforms. His interaction with designers are in bi-weekly about design firmware for new platform developments.

Now, let's discuss the rules. We will give one allegation per team, and the other team has to defend that allegation. We have allocated 10 minutes for each allegation. The discussion will involve designers giving allegations on developers and vice versa, with defences from both sides.

Thank you for joining us on the panel. I'm supporting Team Developers. Who else is in for Team Developers? (Laughter) Okay, okay. So, I think AJ sir, if he's around, was also supporting Team Developers. For those who don't know, AJ sir has a B.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Bombay. So, when he comes here, he'll be supporting Team Developers, not Team Designers. Let's hand it over to Bhavna, who will also be the moderator for the event. Over to you, Bhavna, the limelight is all yours.

##### Bhavna (Moderator)

We'll start with Team Designers and Team Developers. The first allegation from designers to developers is that you occasionally prioritize speed over quality, leading to rushed solutions. Designers, you'll have the opportunity to add to this allegation before developers justify themselves. The same goes for developers; you can add to the allegations before designers defend themselves.

##### Divya (Designer)

Sure, I can go first. There have been instances where we have an ideal scenario with everything ready on our end: all the Figma files, documentation, etc. We hand them off to developers, and the first reaction is often, "We can’t do this," or "That's not possible." Sometimes, it's not even a matter of possibility; it's just that it will take too much time or is deemed impossible. This compromise impacts the quality and overall product experience. The end-user doesn't care about our technical constraints; they just want to use the product. That's how some of the projects I've worked on have panned out.

##### Gyan (Designer)

Let me go next. I understand the need for speed in fast-paced environment. There’s always constraints with time. Something I would like to hear from you is, about the accumulation of design debt over time when we keep prioritizing speed over quality? And do you think there are instances where it's justified to prioritize speed over quality?

##### Nagaraj (Developer)

Yeah, it's a valid point, and this is our business scenario. We need to deliver more to get more user trials. The demand has changed; people are now waiting for new features and we're catering to different market segments. By rushing solutions and prioritizing time-to-market, we can get the feedback we need to improve. That would be one reason why we might prioritize speed over quality.

So, I'm not saying quality is not important, but quality is not the only thing, right? We need to provide solutions as well. It has to be through several iteration cycles to get to know user opinions and market trends. Only then can we develop a good solution over time.

##### Ayush (Developer)

I'd like to add to this. Perfection is rarely achieved in the first round. It takes several iterations. You need to understand user opinions in the market. Only then you can have a good solution over time.

##### Nikhil (Developer)

There's something called a POC (Proof of Concept). First, we need a POC. If you're not launching something in the market, what's the point? Products need to be monetized. Many products are coming into the market one by one, but those that launch first get more attention. Bard came after ChatGPT, but ChatGPT got more attention. Why? Because it was launched first. They’ll keep improving - 3.5, 4, 4.5 will come along. Launching first gives you a strong foothold in the market.

##### (Developer)

It's more about trade-offs in tech, business, and product. You have to decide what trade-off you're willing to make. Sometimes you aim for perfection but lose your customers in the end. Compromises have to be made, but as we receive feedback on how the product is doing as part of the business and monetization strategy, we can make incremental releases. However, maintaining quality consistently is also a considerable point.

##### Moderator

Thanks, thanks a lot, Manish. Let's give it to team designers now, let's have some collabs going on.

##### Designer1

I understand the point of building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first and getting it to market. We're a team with limited resources, so we try to focus on tasks that are high impact but low effort, leaving things in the backlog that are high effort and high impact. Those tasks can improve the user experience but often get ignored, causing persistent pain points for users.

##### Developer5

If a feature or experience is important, we'll get that feedback from the ground. Those items become priority zero and need to be developed immediately to prevent product failure. We have to prioritize, especially when dealing with crucial security-related features or production situations. We also focus on unblocking development teams to keep the cycle moving forward.

##### Developer6

We take into account not just low effort and high importance, but also feature frequency and market analysis. There's an 80-20 concept; if 80% of people are using only 20% of features, we focus more on those.

##### Designer2

As designers, we can be idealistic. We envision things that may not be feasible to code. However, understanding the conceptual model of how code works can help bridge the gap between idealism and pragmatism. This helps in presenting more effective designs that can actually be developed.

This discussion illustrates the tension between the priorities and approaches of designers and developers. Both sides recognize the constraints of limited resources and the need for prioritization, but they differ in their focus. Designers worry about leaving impactful but difficult tasks in the backlog, while developers prioritize based on immediate feedback and security needs.
