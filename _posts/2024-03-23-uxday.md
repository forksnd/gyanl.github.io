Microsoft UX Day 2024 celebrated "The AI Moment", and brought together the design community to discuss and learn more about this revolutionary new technology that is changing the field of product design. This year, we opened our doors to the larger design community, allowing them to join us live for this exciting occasion across Microsoft offices in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Noida.

###### I hosted the event in Noida along with my colleague Anjali

and we also moderated the panel discussion. Behind the scenes, I also worked with Parinishtha and Meher on the website.

The real impact of the session was in the diverse points of view from each speaker, leveraging their unique backgrounds to share insights into the current state of GenAI, the path forward and the looming potential impact on digital product design as a discipline.  

As I reflect on the success of Microsoft UX Day 2024, I'm filled with pride and excitement for what the future holds. Here's to many more moments of inspiration, collaboration, and innovation in the world of UX design!
