In December 2021, I started working on a new project at Microsoft. The PowerPoint Intelligence team had been working on the Designer pane for a while - the feature analysed the content on your current slide, and then intelligently suggested typographic treatments, layouts, media and transitions that could be applied to the slide in one-click. It worked well, and there was a lot of user love for the ability to instantly improve the quality of their slides with a low-effort action.

The elevator pitch for Designer was simple - what if we took the simplicity of PowerPoint’s Designer pane, and built a graphic design tool around the concept of AI suggestions and automation? This tool could take the complex task of creating visually pleasing layouts by eliminating a lot of the decision making around fonts, colors, imagery, branding - and instead 

image - do you like this? no, something different yes, keep it.

The graphical content creation space is a crowded domain - Canva, Adobe, (other competes)

The Designer project started with the PowerPoint Inspire me team at Microsoft. They had developed a system to offer dynamic layouts 

I started working on Designer in December 2021, and created much of the framework we used to port functionality from the web to mobile devices. 

### Complex actions on mobile

Scaling a desktop web app to a mobile device. Context - Showing and hiding menus based on what is the current active item. Scalable architecture with a general flow, special cases.

### Done and cancel

Done only
Done and cancel


### Simplified decision architecture
A key part of the Designer experience was the idea of a novice user to be able to open up the app and be able to create something just by fiddling with the options - the app uses controlled chaos to generate design ideas with a single tap.

For the end user, the app attempts to narrow down decisions from “Which of these 100 options do I like?” to “Do I like this or should I try something else?”


### Using generative AI with Dall-E 2

Dall-e 2 and other generative AI models have sparked discussions
- are really cool
- currently hard to use, users have to learn how to nudge the Ai towards results using keywords.
- black box model where changing just a few characters gives completely different results
- text is garbage
