#### Moved out (again)

Mussoorie 

Meeting colleagues for the first time

#### Got Covid

After holding out for over two years, I finally got caught the big C. I was pretty horrible for about two days, and the brain fog I briefly experienced really freaked me out - but I think I escaped relatively unscathed from the experience. 

#### IDC Reunion

I went to Pune and then Bombay to meet my college friends, many of whom I had not met since college abruptly sent us back home in March 2020. 

#### Shimla trip

Rabail and friends

Spent some time with my grandparents

#### Dehradun and Mussoorie with work 

Short trip with work friends

#### Goa for a month

#### Changed teams

### Teaching

Online workshop
