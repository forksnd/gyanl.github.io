As I work on Copilot for Microsoft Word, I’ve been thinking about interfaces where humans can interact with LLMs. I read a great article by Maggie Appleton[^1] that inspired me to write about some of these thoughts.

### Autocomplete

Github Copilot has a fascinating interaction where typing a comment suggests a piece of code that does what the function describes. This is a unique interaction that works extremely well for code as it matches the pattern of a well documented piece of software, but is more difficult to implement for writing in English - one rarely describes the content of the following paragraph, so this type of interaction is mostly limited to suggesting the next few words.

### Assistants with personality

Giving GPT a “persona” helps generate better results in a given domain. Giving the assistant a persona can help users understand what types of results they’ll get and change the persona to suit their use case. There could be a “professor” persona who critiques academic writing and enables plugins for checking plagiarism and finding sources.
