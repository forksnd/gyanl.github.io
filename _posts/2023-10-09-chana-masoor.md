A slightly complicated dal prepared in two stages to ensure each type of dal is cooked to the right consistency.

#### Servings

Approximately 4 servings (confirm)

### Ingredients

- Chana Dal, 75 grams
- Lal Masoor Dal, 75 grams
- Water, 3x by weight of each dal for soaking
- Haldi (turmeric) powder, 1 tsp
- Salt, 2 tsp
- Garam masala, 1 tsp
- Rai (black mustard seeds), 2 tsp
- Mustard oil, 2 tbsp
- Green chili, 1, chopped
- Ghee, 1/2 tsp
- Jeera (cumin seeds), 1/2 tsp
- Onions, 2 medium or 3 small, finely chopped
- Garlic, 3-4 cloves, finely chopped
- Ginger, a small piece, finely chopped
- Tomato, 1 large or 2 small, either finely chopped or blended to a paste
- Fresh coriander leaves, for garnish

#### Instructions

1. **Preparation of Dal**: Rinse both Chana Dal and Lal Masoor Dal separately until the water runs clear. Soak them in 225 grams of water each for 2-3 hours.

2. **Spice and Oil Mixture**: In an open pressure cooker, heat 2 tablespoons of mustard oil and 1/2 teaspoon of ghee. Add 1/2 teaspoon of jeera and 2 teaspoons of rai.

3. **Frying Spices**: Fry the mixture until the jeera and rai start to pop.

4. **Adding Aromatics**: Add finely chopped onions, garlic, and a piece of ginger to the cooker. (Alternatively, you can blend these together to save time.)

5. **Saut√©**: Fry the aromatics for a while until they turn translucent.

6. **Add Tomato**: Incorporate the finely chopped or blended tomato into the mixture. Stir and let it simmer for a minute or two.

7. **Chana Dal**: Add the Chana Dal along with its soaking water. Close the pressure cooker and let it whistle twice (2 seeti). Turn off the heat and allow the cooker to lose steam naturally.

8. **Masoor Dal**: Once you can safely open the cooker, add the Lal Masoor Dal along with its soaking water. Close the lid again and allow for two more whistles (2 seeti).

9. **Final Touch**: Open the cooker after the steam has naturally released. Stir well and garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a squeeze of lemon.
