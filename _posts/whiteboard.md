Don't decide the output format at the beginning of the project.

Don't limit yourself by assuming you can't handle a medium. Designers are problem solvers, you can solve problems with different tools. Don't hammer and nail.


**Do you need a design degree?**

No, you don't. That's not just me saying that, the industry is happy to accept designers who studied engineering, architecture, business, or pretty much anything else. You can be self taught and have a fantastic career as a designer.

Design used to be quite insular, tech not so much. 



**What does design school help with?**

Not just the craft, skills, 

Critical thinking, deeply understanding the problem. "Invisible skills"

Design thinking is thrown around a lot. 

Skills as a result of experimenting with tools. 


Self taught route you can also focus on these things. Do justice to the problems you are solving. 

Read about unrelated things. Philosophy. Society. Culture. Read about the world to be a better designer. 


**Case study recipe.**

- tight narrative
- every part of the case study contributes to the narrative
- breadth depends on context.
- portfolio site doesn't need to have 100% context, just enough to hook someone in. you'll talk more about it in the interview anyway. 
- if this was a book/movie, how will you keep audience hooked till the end? 
- surprise, twists?
