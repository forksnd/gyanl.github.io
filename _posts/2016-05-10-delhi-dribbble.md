One day as I was on Dribbble, I stumbled upon their meetups section. I realised there hadn't been one in Delhi, so my friend Raghav and I decided to organise one.

We had 14 designers from various fields talk about their experiences with design, their processes, as well as tips theyâ€™ve picked up over the years.

###### This looks interesting.

Since this went pretty well, I plan on organising more designer meetups like this one. Join the Delhi Designers [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1532818907016936/) to get updates about any future events.
