#### Apple Homepod (The big one, not Homepod mini)  

_You can throw a party with just one of these, it sounds really good and gets super loud. It's a solid smart speaker if you're mostly in the Apple ecosystem, and especially if you use Apple music._

#### Xbox Series S (with Series X/S Controller)   
_I don't have as much time as I would have liked to play games so I'm letting my Xbox go. It's in great condition and comes with the original box, HDMI 2.1 cable, power cable and controller._

#### Xbox One Controller 

*Mostly the same as Series S controller except no dedicated share button and it uses Micro-USB instead of USB-C. Also works with Windows and Apple devices for games via Bluetooth or USB. The standard box doesn't have a Micro-USB cable but I bought one so I'll include that.*

#### 1 Year Code for Gamepass Ultimate

*Gamepass ultimate for Xbox + PC. Gets you access to a bunch of indie games as well as enough big name titles that you probably won't need to buy any games while you have the subscription. There's always something fun to play or new to try out on Gamepass.*
