#### Apple Homepod (The big one, not Homepod mini)  

_You can throw a party with just one of these, it sounds really good and gets super loud. It's a solid smart speaker if you're mostly in the Apple ecosystem, and especially if you use Apple music._

#### Xbox Series S (with Series X/S Controller)

#### Xbox One Controller

#### 1 Year Code for Gamepass Ultimate
