#### Logitech C310 clip-on 720p Webcam

*Photo clarity is about as good as your average laptop webcam. Connects over USB and clips on to the top of a monitorâ€”see the monitor listing towards the end of this page to see how it looks mounted on the monitor. Also has a built in mic, but it intermittently sounds high pitched so I wouldn't rely on it for audio.*
