# Hello!

Welcome to my garage sale. Feel free to look around. Items can be picked up from my house in Delhi NCR (Vasant Kunj) or I could Dunzo the smaller items. Message me on [WhatsApp](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=7982121546&text&type=phone_number) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gyanl) if you have questions or want photos/more details. I may be willing to consider trade offers (do you have a monitor arm or an amplifier?).

#### Xbox Series S (with Series X/S Controller)   

_I don't have as much time as I would have liked to play games so I'm letting my Xbox go. It's in great condition and comes with the original box, HDMI 2.1 cable, power cable and controller._

**Amazon:** [Xbox Series S](https://www.amazon.in/Xbox-Series-S/dp/B08J89D6BW/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YOU2FSSIS5XV&keywords=xbox&qid=1657347496&sprefix=xbo%2Caps%2C192&sr=8-1) (33,299)

**My price:** 25k

**Status:** 🟢 Available

<br>

#### Xbox One Controller 

*Mostly the same as Series S controller except no dedicated share button and it uses Micro-USB instead of USB-C. Fully compatible with previous gen Xbox One and current gen Series S and Series X. Also works with Windows and Apple devices for games via Bluetooth or USB. The standard box doesn't have a Micro-USB cable but I bought one so I'll include that.*

**Flipkart:** [HomePod](https://www.flipkart.com/apple-homepod-siri-assistant-smart-speaker/p/itmd613189c4a516) (19,900)

<br>

#### Canon EOS 1300D DSLR Camera

*Great if you want to get into photography and learn to shoot manual but aren't sure if you want to invest 50-60k into a new mirrorless camera. In outdoor lighting you can get stunning photos that are still way better than any phone camera. Also has a feature to wirelessly transfer photos to phones, so you can totally post to the 'gram on the go.*

#### Wood desk  

_A large desk that I got custom made because I couldn't find something big enough for my liking. It has a nice geometric form and served me well, but I'm shifting houses and can't take it with me._

**My price:** 6k

<br>

#### Google Chromecast Audio

![](https://gyanl.com/assets/sale-chromecast-audio.jpg)

*Do you have an old pair of speakers lying around that still sound good, but it's just too much hassle to actually use them anymore? Hook up this Chromecast to it with a 3.5mm audio cable and it can now play music over WiFi. (Also supports digital audio but you'll need to separately buy a Mini Toslink to Toslink cable for that.)*

**Flipkart:** [Google Chromecast Audio Media Streaming Device](https://www.flipkart.com/google-chromecast-audio-media-streaming-device/p/itmehc8cdsd4bk9q) (3,299)

**My Price:** 500

#### iPhone 11 (Black, 128GB)

**My price:** 20k

**Status:** ❌ Sold

<br>

#### Kindle Paperwhite (7th Generation)

*Kindle with a backlit screen. Great for reading on the go, the e-ink screen feels a lot like paper and the battery lasts forever. Newer kindles have smaller bezels and more lighting options but e-ink display technology hasn't changed much, so this is still a great Kindle.*

#### Red Chair 

_An office chair with a red cushioned base. It served me well for a year of working from home. It’s surprisingly comfortable for the price—I bought it because it was a cool color and actually nicer to sit on than some more expensive models. The wheels aren't particularly smooth and the back support lever is a bit wonky. But it's also 2k._

**Original price:** 4k

**My price:** 2k

**Status:** ❌ Sold

<br>
#### Logitech G102 Gaming Mouse

*High sensitivity gaming mouse that's also great for general use. Has customisable RGB lights and two programmable side buttons you can map to any action either globally or per app using the Logitech software. I got a similiar wireless model soon after so it's in great condition—comes with original box and wasn't used much.*

**My price:** 1000

**Status:** ❌ Sold

<br>

#### Asus ROG Gaming PC

_Gaming PC that can play most games at good framerates at 1080p. RGB lights for extra gamer power. Power button is a bit loose and needs to be jiggled a little for initial boot but otherwise in good condition._

Amazon: [Tenda AC10 AC1200 Wireless Smart Dual-Band Gigabit WiFi Router](https://www.amazon.in/Tenda-AC10-1200Mbps-Wireless-Router/dp/B07DGPYKLP) (2498) 

**My price:** 1000

**Status:** ❌ Sold

<br>

#### Wacom Pen & Touch drawing tablet with stylus

*A great entry-level drawing tablet. Can switch between pen mode and a touch mode using a switch on the device - touch mode essentially converts the surface into a giant trackpad with multi-touch gestures like pinch to zoom and swipe.*

#### Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro (Android Phone)

#### LG 25 inch Ultrawide monitor (2560x1080)

_LG Monitor with a pixel density of ~110 PPI, which makes it one of the few monitors that can be used perfectly with MacOS at native scaling. Has been my daily driver for about two years, and the colors are good enough to use for design work. Selling it cheap because of some scratches on the screen - not very noticeable unless you're on a plain white screen._

#### HP Envy 14 inch laptop (1080p)

_Old laptop, not in great condition. Has three dead pixel bands on the screen. It does have a generous amount of RAM and a graphics card so it’s not a terrible machine if you’re willing to tinker with it._
