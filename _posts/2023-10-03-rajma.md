### Instructions

1. **Preparation**: Soak the rajma (kidney beans) overnight in the water. Drain the water the next day.

2. **Spice and Oil Mix**: In a pressure cooker, heat mustard oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds, jeera, rai, and curry patta. Stir until the seeds start popping.
   
3. **Sauté Aromatics**: Add 1 chopped onion and a tablespoon of ghee to the spice mix. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent.
   
4. **Add More Flavors**: Incorporate finely chopped ginger and minced garlic into the mix. Stir well.
   
5. **Spices**: Add red chili powder, salt, sookha dhania, a few cranks of black pepper, haldi, and garam masala. Stir to combine all the ingredients well.
   
6. **Tomato Puree**: Add the pureed tomatoes to the spice mix in the pressure cooker. Mix well.
   
7. **Combine with Rajma**: Add the soaked and drained rajma to the cooker. Mix thoroughly.
   
8. **Cooking**: Close the pressure cooker lid and let it cook until you hear 4 or 5 whistles (seeti).
   
9. **Check and Serve**: Once the pressure has released naturally, open the cooker and give the rajma a good stir. Adjust seasoning if necessary and serve hot.
