I have an idea I like thinking about sometimes - how does the shape of the tool impact what someone can create with it? If youâ€™re designing a tool that will be used by people to create something, it's interesting to think about how your design decisions will impact what others will be able to make with the tool.

Let's start with an example from calligraphy. Devanagari lettering, used for Hindi and other languages, is traditionally done with a pen angled at around 45 degrees. This angle is what gives Devanagari its characteristic shape, with its sweeping curves and distinctive loops. The shape of the tool, in this case, the angled pen, is what dictates what can be created with it. If you were to try to create Devanagari lettering with a straight pen, or use the 55 degree pen angle typically used by Latin calligraphy, it would look quite different. The character of Devanagari calligraphy is a very direct result of how the pen is created.

The impact of tool shape isn't limited to calligraphy, however. Let's consider digital tools like Photoshop. In previous versions of Photoshop, the default setting for the scale tool was non-proportional scaling. This meant that when you scaled an object, it was very easy to squish or stretch the image in one direction. People starting out with Photoshop would often end up inadvertently distorting images. With later versions of Photoshop, the default setting for the scale tool was changed to proportional scaling, which maintains the aspect ratio of the object being scaled. This change reduced how frequently Photoshop users accidentally stretched an image.

While using Canva, I noticed something odd - it doesn't have an underline option. The underline has long existed as a way of emphasizing words - and many Canva users could want to try and underline something on say, a social media post. The visual language of the internet however uses underlines to denote links - and thus canva avoids users making things look like links by intentionally making it hard to use underlines on their app.
