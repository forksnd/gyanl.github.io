### Key OKRs

1. Develop and finalize concepts for creation and consumption using Generative AI on mobile and iPad platforms.
2. Improve iPad retention by identifying feature gaps and optimizing ease of use.
3. Foster a positive, productive culture within the Word team, NH44.

### Impact Summary

1. _Designer Mobile (till Jan 2023)_: Initiated the task to reimagine the web version of Designer for mobile. A desktop-to-mobile feature adaption framework was created, leading to the development of a Figma design library for Designer mobile. Collaborated with the Engineering team to generate 1:1 code components, which resulted in more efficient product iterations. The impact was substantial, as it set the foundation for all current Designer mobile screens.
    
2. _Word for iPad_: Successfully made improvements to core functionalities like tables, borders, and shared menu enhancements on iPad, which will eventually benefit all WXP apps. These improvements are anticipated to increase user retention as they address the requirements of paid users. Also conducted competitive analysis to identify areas of improvement across various iPad interaction modalities - touch, stylus, and keyboard+trackpad.
    
3. _Office AI HVC_: Collaborated with the Office AI team to design the first version of the Copilot HVC with Word as a partner app. This early partnership ensured Word scenarios were the first ones to be built, and Word will be the first Office app to support Copilot on mobile.
    
### Reflection on Challenges

Over time, my responsibilities at Microsoft have expanded, leading to multiple ongoing tasks and greater decision-making autonomy. This occasionally results in difficulty focusing on individual tasks. However, through managerial guidance, I am learning to distinguish between tasks that require simple completion versus those that warrant exceptional effort. In addition, I am improving communication regarding my workload and availability, and adjusting plans as priorities shift.

### Core Priorities

1. Application of emerging patterns around designing generative and transformational text experiences with LLMs in line with user research and industry trends.
2. Focusing on feature parity and ease of use for web applications, supporting the team accordingly.
3. Activating and leveraging Copilot on Word Mobile and iPad to enhance user engagement and productivity.

### Measures of Success

1. Launch and iterate a Copilot experience (possibly Word on Android) in collaboration with the NUI team on Copilot HVC.
2. Contribute to Fluent AI design patterns as part of the Fluent AI v-team.
3. Create a Word iPad specific Figma design library and maintain it.
4. Conduct user research regularly to continually improve Word on iPad and Web.

### D&I Core Priority Activation

I aim to improve the accessibility documentation for designers to better cater to differently abled people. I also plan to host knowledge sharing sessions on various topics like the State of AI technologies and Advanced Figma functionalities. Furthermore, I am working on a new employee onboarding project to enhance the initial experience of new hires at Microsoft.

**Learning, Growth, and Development Actions**

To support my growth, I aim to improve my time management skills, handle ambiguity with greater executive maturity, and strengthen my soft skills. Also, I look forward to setting up efficient processes for the team and gaining the confidence to constructively challenge PM requests when needed.

**Support Needed**

Perspective or coaching on time management and executive maturity. Learning on handling ambiguity, setting up efficient processes, and asserting constructive criticism.
