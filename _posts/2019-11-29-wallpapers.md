### Personal Motto

I made these wallpapers as a reminder to plan out what I want to do, do one thing at a time, and try new things. They have now become a personal meme of sorts. Watch me ruthlessly prioritize getting Biryani twice a week and eat it with singular focus. Typeset in Space Grotesk, one of my current favorite fonts.

### Pixel City

I got really into glitch art, and made this using pixel sorting.

### Skateboard

Midjourney prompt hacking. My prompt was “Abstract elements in cool, saturated neon gradients on a dark background, flowing layers of materials with reflections, holographic iridescent glass, shadows, 8k, hd render, masterpiece, space themed --s 750 --weird 3000 --ar 16:9”
