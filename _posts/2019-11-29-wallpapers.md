### Personal Motto

I made these wallpapers as a reminder to plan out what I want to do, do one thing at a time, and try new things. They have now become a personal meme of sorts. Watch me ruthlessly prioritize getting Biryani twice a week and eat it with singular focus. Typeset in Space Grotesk, one of my current favorite fonts.

### Pixel City

I got really into glitch art, and made this using pixel sorting.
