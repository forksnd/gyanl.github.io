###### Figma Fun Friday

I conducted a Design Systems in Figma workshop at the [NowForm](https://nowform.co/)studio. I use my experience as a UX Designer at Microsoft where I’ve contributed to design systems that power robust experiences used by millions of people to give practical tips to speed up workflows and maintain consistent, scalable design systems. I also explain the mental models required to think about Constraints, Autolayout, Components, Variants and other advanced Figma features.
