###### Figma Fun Friday

I recently conducted a workshop on "Design Systems in Figma" at the [NowForm](https://nowform.co/) studio. Drawing from my experience as a UX Designer at Microsoft, where I've contributed to the development of design systems that power robust experiences for millions of users, I offered practical tips to speed up workflows and maintain consistent and scalable design systems.

Additionally, I delved into the mental models required to effectively utilize advanced Figma features, such as:

- Constraints
- Auto Layout
- Components
- Variants

The workshop aimed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to streamline their design processes and create more cohesive and efficient design systems.
