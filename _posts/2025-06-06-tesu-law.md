My friend Pranav asked me if I could design the brand and landing page for a firm he was starting with another lawyer. I love my friend Pranav and I agreed. 

Tesu Law, named after the tree with bright red flowers became an opportunity for me to design something that was tasteful and minimal. I also found out that due to Indian laws around lawyers soliciting customers, there’s very little “selling” that law firms can do. This is in stark contrast to all the discussion about conversion rates and funnels that landing pages usually come with.
