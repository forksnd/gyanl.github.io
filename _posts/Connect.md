# Looking back

### What contributions did you make this period and what was the resulting business impact?

_Share 3-5 highlights outlining WHAT you did (touch briefly on the HOW here), WHY you did it, and the IMPACT you had. Did you touch on all three circles of impact (pictured above) and the shared core priority for diversity & inclusion?_

- Took the north star vision presented to Rajesh Jha in and other LT, and fleshed out that vision into the first versions of both Designer Mobile Static and Video.
  
- Supported Agrima with rapid ideation and prototyping, eventually took ownership over her area when she went on leave. Evolved the concepts in the working files into polished, consistent designs using the Designer Mobile Figma library.
  
- Created a design system and a Figma library of components for use across Designer Mobile static and video. Maintained the library and imported style changes from web library so all mocks stayed consistent without requiring manual updates. Worked with engineering to implement these designs in code. This helped us move quickly without repeating work or creating ambiguity.

- Helped Akhil onboard onto the Designer team and be set up for success in a fast-moving team. Supported him with questions about Video HVC area that I previously owned and continued to support him with regular syncs and brainstorming sessions to help move designs forward quickly.
  
- Ideated on design concepts that could be USPs for Designer, conducted user testing to get early feedback and course correct based on customer feedback.


### What could you have done differently for even greater business impact?

_Emphasize 2-3 things that “YOU” individually could have done differently. Use “I” instead of “we” or “they” to highlight what you learned. What happened? What did you learn? What perspectives from your colleagues were helpful? How can you apply what you learned going forward?_

- I was less connected to customers over the past few months than I would have liked to be - while I tested many of our prototypes and got qualitative feedback that way, I did not do open-ended, foundational research into customer problems. This could have helped generate empathy and informed some of our design decisions earlier in the process.
  
- The past two quarters have been challenging due to the rapid pace of work and constantly shifting priorities, goals and deadlines. In an attempt to not let engineering be blocked, I often started and then abandoned work areas in favor of more urgent and immediate items, which later lead to confusion about what was “finished”. I should have escalated this issue and insisted on a more organised process to be followed and asked for support, as trying to solve this on my own level to a lower actual output in the long run.


### What are your key deliverables and the expected business impact for the upcoming period?

_Does your work align with your core priorities? Discuss with your manager if your core priorities need to be updated. What will you do to activate the company-wide core priority(s) this upcoming period?_

- Continue to try and ship a polished mobile experience for Designer.
- Ideate on what makes Designer mobile different from compete, play to our strengths in generative AI and automating the grunt work of the design process

### What will you do in the upcoming period to learn and grow? Consider the experiences or skills you would like to build for your growth and development. See [Career Development Resources](https://aka.ms/career) to support you.

_Be specific about what you are going to do and why. Leverage perspectives you received to prioritize opportunities to learn or try something new. What are your future career plans and how can your manager support you?_

- I enjoy sharing what I have learned with others, and I have spent a lot of time trying to teach both design tools and techniqiues inside and outside of Microsoft. This is something I want to do more of, and will find more opportunities inside of Microsoft as well - such as DoL or internship mentoring.

- I want to develop my skills as a UX Researcher, and be in a position where I can plan and execute studies more frequently. This would require UX Research to be made part of the planning cycle so that there is bandwidth allocated for this.
