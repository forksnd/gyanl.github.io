## Setup

- [Sign up for Figma](https://www.figma.com/signup?locale=en)
- Either run it in the browser or optionally [download Figma for Mac/Windows](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)
- Download the Figma Mirror mobile app for Android/iOS (fair warning the Android app can be a bit buggy)

## The double diamond design process
- Research/exploring the problem space
- Picking a narrow problem statement
- Divergent ideation
- Converge on a single solution


## It's good to fail

You have an idea. It's brilliant! It's the best idea ever!

You find an underground bunker and work non-stop for 6 months. You don't shower, which I don't advise. You come out and show it to the world, but nobody wants it. Plus you smell funny.

- When testing solutions, it's good to fail as early in the process as possible and spend as little effort on your prototypes as possible.
- Building digital products out in code takes time and effort, creating lower fidelity prototypes is a faster way to validate ideas.

## Levels of prototyping fidelity

#### Pen and paper

Hard to beat. It's pen and paper. It's great to start here. 

#### Wireframes

Outline versions of the interface. Great when you don't want to get bogged down by visual design decisions like colors, fonts, spacing, etc.

#### UI Design/Mockups

Visually detailed "mockups" of the app. Can look visually indistinguishable from the working code.

- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)

#### High fidelity Prototyping

Allow a higher level of detail, can access things like device keyboard or location, has conditional logic.

- [ProtoPie](https://www.protopie.io/)
- [Principle](https://principleformac.com/)
- [Origami Studio](https://origami.design/)

#### Low code/No-code tools

GUI editor that spits out working code, you can write custom code as well.

- [Webflow](https://webflow.com)
- [Framer](https://www.framer.com/)

#### Working code

Wow, you built an app!
