## Setup
- [Sign up for Figma](https://www.figma.com/signup?locale=en)
- Either run it in the browser or optionally [download Figma for Mac/Windows](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)
- Download the Figma Mirror mobile app for Android/iOS (fair warning the Android app can be a bit buggy)
- Open this file: [Rapid Prototyping in Figma - Workshop](https://www.figma.com/file/C2CRd3mXBcyL2ySwBASqVp/Figma-Basics?node-id=0%3A1)

## The double diamond design process
- Research/exploring the problem space
- Picking a narrow problem statement
- Divergent ideation
- Converge on a single solution


## It's good to fail

You have an idea. It's brilliant! It's the best idea ever!

You find an underground bunker and work non-stop for 6 months. You don't shower, which I don't advise. You come out and show it to the world, but nobody wants it. Plus you smell funny.

- When testing solutions, it's good to fail as early in the process as possible - make quick and dirty prototypes, learn from them, and then iterate.
- Building digital products out in code takes time and effort, creating lower fidelity prototypes is a faster way to validate ideas.


## Levels of prototyping fidelity

#### Pen and paper

Hard to beat. It's pen and paper. It's great to start here. 

#### Wireframes

Outline versions of the interface. Great when you don't want to get bogged down by visual design decisions like colors, fonts, spacing, etc.

#### UI Design/Mockups

Visually detailed "mockups" of the app. Can look visually indistinguishable from the working code. 

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)

#### High fidelity Prototyping

Allow a higher level of detail, can access things like device keyboard or location, has conditional logic.

- [Principle](https://principleformac.com/)
- [Origami Studio](https://origami.design/)

#### Low code/No-code tools

GUI editor that spits out working code, you can write custom code as well.

- [Webflow](https://webflow.com)
- [Framer](https://www.framer.com/)

#### Working code

Wow, you built an app!

## Figma community

Other Figma users upload their files, you can create a copy and modify it to your needs.

- People upload these voluntarily so it's perfectly fine to use them
- Some files will have a demo and then a payment link to access the full version

## Figma basics


#### Pages
- Infinite pages with "frames" on them
- Scroll in any direction
- Pinch to zoom

#### Frame
- A container for content, typically the mockup for a screen goes into a frame
- Figma has presets for the size that works best for some popular devices 
- Keyboard shortcut F to select Frame tool, then draw the frame rectangle
- Click on the name of the frame to select, then click and drag to move frames around

#### Components

Sometimes when you click on a group or frame, it'll have a 

components basic explanation, how to detach

## Prototyping in Figma

#### Design / Prototype / Inspect

The right menu in Figma has 3 modes:

- Design lets you edit properties of objects
- Prototype lets you connect screens and decide transition animations
- Inspect lets you view design details in a dev-friendly format, and generates some code

#### Connecting screens

Go to prototype mode and then

- Click on the object you want as a starting point
- Drag the prototype handle to the screen

Fun fact: the official term for the lines indicating the prototype linkages is 'noodle'!
