> While this is a legal document, it’s very unlikely that it’ll be worth it for you as a freelancer to go after a client who breaches the agreement. Having a signed agreement will largely only help you with having a document to refer back to in case there are disagreements later. I’ve found that by creating such a written document, some of those potential disagreements about scope, payment and timelines are automatically avoided.
