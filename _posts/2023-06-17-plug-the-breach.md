As our digital footprint expands, so too does the risk of data breaches. This is a particularly concerning issue in an age where our lives are increasingly "datafied" and personal information is stored across a multitude of platforms, often without adequate safeguards. Despite the growing threat, data breaches occur in a legal vacuum, void of policy for data governance, data protection legislation, or cybersecurity strategy. Whether it's government-held data or information held by private companies, when a breach occurs, citizens are frequently kept in the dark, without any confirmation, clarification, or compensation.

In the face of this growing digital threat, the Internet Freedom Foundation launched a novel project called "Plug The Breach," a dedicated website that tracks data breaches and endeavors to bring accountability to this often nebulous space. As a design volunteer with IFF, I had the opportunity to contribute to this project.
