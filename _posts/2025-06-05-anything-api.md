###### Try it at [api.gyanl.com](http://api.gyanl.com)

One of my older AI projects had stopped working because the OpenAI davinci model had become too old and stopped working. I was puttering around with the server code that returned a json with some values and thoughtâ€¦ if it can do this, it can probably do anything else too.

This lead to the following bit of code that takes any request at api.gyanl.com/path, takes the path, and tells an AI model to pretend that there was a working api at that path and return a json. The user can optionally specify fields to return. 

```
const { catchall, fields } = req.query;
  const path = req.url.split('?')[0]; // Get the path part of the URL

  try {
    // System prompt to guide the AI
    let systemPrompt = `You are a creative AI assistant that lives at api.gyanl.com and generates JSON responses for any endpoint. Your responses must be in well-structured JSON format with the least fields possible. The user is requesting information for the endpoint: ${path}.`;

    if (fields) {
      systemPrompt += ` Please include only the following fields in your response: ${fields}.`;
    }

    // Actual AI call
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4-1106-preview", // Use gpt-4.1-mini or gpt-4-1106-preview as available
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
        { role: "user", content: `Generate a creative JSON response for the endpoint: ${path}` }
      ],
      response_format: { type: "json_object" },
      max_tokens: 400,
    });
```
